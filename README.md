# pfs-sessiontracker-userscript
A quick userscript to create json files out of PFS games played.

Install with Tampermonkey / Greasemonkey

I don't have all the correct paths for Paizo listed, so until that's fixed, just log in to Paizo and go here:

https://secure.paizo.com/store/byCompany/p/paizoInc/pathfinder/pathfinderSociety/myAccount/sessions

You have to expand the tabs before hitting export(s).  I'll fix that later too.
