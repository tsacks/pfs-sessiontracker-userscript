# pfs-sessiontracker-userscript
A quick userscript to create json files out of PFS games played.

1. Download Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey. These are addons for browsers to help you execute a export script on paizo.com.
2. Download and install the userscript for paizo.com from this repo.
3. Log into Paizo.com, go to "Pathfinder Society -> My Pathfinder Society -> Sessions
4. A small popup should then give you two options: Saving played info and saving ran info. Make sure you extend both tabs on this page and then choose one of the options.
5. Go to https://tracker.campaigncodex.com/, then log into your account.  Then go to the import tool (https://tracker.campaigncodex.com/#/import) and paste in your json
6. Kick back and enjoy!
